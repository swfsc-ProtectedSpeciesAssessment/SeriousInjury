#' @description
#' Define covariates from whale injury narratives based on presence or absence of key words or phrases
#' used to predict health outcomes. 'Narratives' (case sensitive) should be in a wide-form data frame
#' in column of same name. Append covariates to data frame using function InjuryCovariates(). Resulting
#' data frame is used with Random Forest classification trees to predict health status of whales involved in
#' entanglements or vessel strikes. Package includes example data frame "WhaleData"

# Multiple words/phrases may be pooled into a single covariate, e.g. the covariate 'decline'
# includes narrative words/phrases 'cyamid', 'whale lice', 'emaciation', 'skin discoloration', etc.
# Covariate string searches use function 'grepl' and may be abbreviated to accommodate different
# states of same word/phrase/meaning. For example, an emaciated whale may include narrative
# references to: 'emacatied', 'emaciation'. Thus, the string 'emaciat' is used with function grepl.
# Covariate misspellings (e.g. 'propeller' vs 'propellar') are coded generically ('propell') to capture
# all occurrences.

# Multiple conditions are identified using string wildcards with grepl() function:
# Narratives including both 'flukes' and 'missing' are identified using grepl("missing.*fluke|fluke.*missing))
# while phrases as 'partially disentangled' and 'partial disentanglement' are handled by grepl("partial.*disentangl)
